Player
jPlayer is nice.
KKRE-specific: we don't have resources to store >50 GiB of audiofiles, and narod.ru servers have hotlinking protection.
Luckily, this protection is basic. We can customize jPlayer a bit and store its flash module on narod.ru with .htm file extension.
This means having modified jplayer.min.js and external jplayer.swf[.htm] URL. Can we keep these modifications out of repo?

Playlinks
Something like /recordingsurl#play:id

Filtered lists customization
Initially we created lists with hardcoded filtering: poets, composers, performers.
We must certianly have performers split into male singers, frmale singers and groups.
We must also have list view for search by person name.

Albums and album types (disc, concert, ...)
