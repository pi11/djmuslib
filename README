Content management system for a musical encyclopedia.

This project was started to develop CMS and service scripts for "Russian Estrade Red Book" ("Krasnaja Kniga Rossijskoj Ð•strady") website.
As of current moment, this website (http://kkre-1.narod.ru/) is a set of manually written webpages with lots of mistakes and inconsistencies, no automatization, no search and other obvious problems. Our goal is to develop a fully-featured content management system with relational database and templates. We also look forward to extend its usage beyond initial purpose.

It is a Django application. To run it, you must place its directory inside your Django project, add it to INSTALLED_APPS in its settings.py and configure URL dispatcher.
It uses Sphinx search server. Search will not work if you do not have it installed and running. Anyway, you will need django-sphinx python module, because DjangoSphinx in imported in models.py.
